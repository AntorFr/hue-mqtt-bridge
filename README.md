# Philips Hue Sensor MQTT Bridge

This should be compatible with multiple Hue bridges, but it has only been tested
with one. Also, this has only been tested with Hue Dimmer.

I have noticed the best performance when running the polling interval at 500ms.

If you have any issues, please post them on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dale3h/hue-mqtt-bridge/issues).
